## Background

I started learning Python for work purposes. One Friday night, while gaming, I decided to try streaming and began tweaking my Twitch channel while streaming. As a result, I ended up developing a Python module overnight that generates free overlays for streamers.

### Key features

#### Create a personalized overlay for your favorite streaming software.

#### Automation capabilities (load the module in your python script and automate overlay creation with pipeline!)

Import the module in your automation scripts to automate changes to your banner while streaming automatically.

## Usage
